### Who we are

I'm Justin, a PhD student in Georgia Tech's ECE department. I'm interested in a bunch of things from harsh environment electronics, to IC design, to signal processing. 

I'm Alex, an embedded systems dev at Northrop Grumman's Space Systems division. When I'm not writing flight software, I'm interested in robust high-performance computing systems, radio astronomy, constraint programming, and just about everything technical related to video games.
