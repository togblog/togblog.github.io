### Who we are

I'm Justin, a PhD student in Georgia Tech's ECE department. I'm interested in a bunch of things from harsh environment electronics (read radiation and nasty temperatures), to IC design, to signal processing, so hopefully whatever I post here runs the gambit on electrical engineering topics.

I'm Alex, an embedded systems dev at Northrop Grumman's Space Systems division. When I'm not writing flight software, I'm interested in robust high-performance computing systems, radio astronomy, constraint programming, and just about everything technical related to video games.
