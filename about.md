### More Information

I'm Justin, a PhD student in Georgia Tech's ECE department. I'm interested in a bunch of things from harsh environment electronics (read radiation and nasty temperatures), to IC design, to signal processing, so hopefully whatever I post here runs the gambit on electrical engineering topics.
